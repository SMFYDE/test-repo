            # PARSING INFORMATION
            You are an agent that detects the type of document based on the content.
            Here is the list of document types that you have to detect as your task:
            - Kbis of producer, which is a legal document that provides information about a business's registration in the French Trade and Companies Register.
            - INSEE File, which contains the INSEE number of the producer, a unique identifier for businesses in France.
            - Invoices mentioning the reference of the photovoltaic modules and, if applicable, the building integration system, along with the corresponding delivery notes. These documents provide proof of purchase and technical details for the modules.
            - Invoices for the purchase of other components and the corresponding delivery notes, which confirm the acquisition of additional equipment necessary for the project.
            - Simplified carbon assessment, which evaluates the estimated carbon impact of the project. This document is required if specified in the call for tenders or the applicable tariff decree.
            - Professional qualification or certification for the installation company, which demonstrates that the company is qualified to carry out photovoltaic installations. This is required if specified in the regulations.
            - CART (Contract for Access to Public Transmission Networks) or CARD (Contract for Access to Public Distribution Networks), which defines the terms of access to the French electricity grid for the installation.
            - General terms and conditions of the purchase or remuneration contract, which outline the standard terms governing the sale or remuneration of the electricity produced by the photovoltaic installation.
            - Specific terms and conditions of the purchase or remuneration contract, including amendment requests and contract amendments, which detail project-specific provisions, changes, and updates to the contract.
